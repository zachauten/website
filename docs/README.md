- What did I pick

This site is effectively a marketing page for the Triangle DSA (TDSA). The goals are to display information about what we believe, what we're working on, and how people can get involved.

In support of this goal, the site also displays a calendar of events, a blog (Left Angles), a merch page, and a page outlining our endorsement process for prospective electeds seeking an endorsement.

These requirements are pretty standard for a typical marketing page, and many tools and frameworks exist to build sites like this (static site generators or SSGs). Because TDSA is a volunteer organization with limited capacity, we wanted to build the site with widely available tools that don't require much expertise, and ideally don't cost much money either.

The tools and frameworks used to build this site are as follows:
- [Astro](https://astro.build/), a React framework, to build the site. It's free and open source, [widely used](https://jamstack.org/generators/), and supports deploying to mulitple platform. 
- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) to manage the merch store, because it's probably the most widely used ecommerce platform.
- Deploying to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) because they have a generous free tier compared to other hosting, and a lot of features.
