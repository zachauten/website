  heading: About North Carolina DSA
  paragraph1: The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States. Our North Carolina chapter is committed to building a more just, equitable, and democratic society across the Tar Heel State.
  paragraph2: We believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. We are a political and activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.
